# My emacs tricks
C-x C-i: shows the functions defined in buffer
--> doesn't work for now

C-x +: Set windows to be of equal size

C-x C-+: increase buffer font size
C-x C--: decrease buffer font size

C-x f: shows recently open files
--> doesn't work right now
C-x C-f M-f: wide find file (search filename in subdirs)

### Help
C-h k: shows functions called by key binding
C-h f: shows function help
C-h v: shows value of an emacs config variable
C-h m: shows all the key bindgins active in the buffer

### Mark
C-<space>: set region start (end is the point)
C-g: cancel region
#### Mark ring
C-u C-<space>: Invoke mark ring

#### Handy navigation trick to vuew other area of buffer and come back
- Set mark
- navigate to wherever you want
- use mark ring to come back at last the set mark

C-x j: kills entire line
C-k: kills end of line from point

### Rectangle mode
Select text in normal fashion.  The rectangle formed by the point at the begining of selection and the one at the end of the selection indicates the rectangle that is going to be used.
C-x r t -> rectangle replace
C-x r y -> rectangle paste
C-x r k -> rectangle kill

### Auto indent
M-\
--> doesn't work for now

C-x m: starts eshell
-> doesn't work right now

### Manually open up mode
M-x <the function mode name>

### Eval code in buffer
M-x eval-buffer

Good way to tryout new config is to use the \*scratch\* buffer and M-x eval-buffer

## cua-mode
Mx- cua-mode: starts cua mode
C-x <enter>: start rectangle text selection
<enter>: stops rectangle text selection
<type stuff before or after rectangle for multiple line edit>
M-n: allows adding number increments on those multiple lines based on where the point is set
C-w: kills entire block
Mx- cua-mode: starts cua mode

## Ruby mode
### Within a ruby buffer these are the specific key bindings
C-c C-s: starts a irb like buffer (with all the emacs nuggets - completion, copy/paste...)
  - M-p: go up in history
  - M-n: go down in history
  - C-c C-r: sends selected region in the irb ruby buffer
### to start this irb outside of ruby-mode use
M-x inf-ruby


## Version control mode
### Shows up in version controlled files
C-x v = does diff against head
c-u C-x v = does diff against any revision
C-x v u Discard any changes since last check-in
C-x v ~ Checkout any revision of the current file


## Magit
### Git mode
C-x g pulls up git status command interface
  P push
  F pull
  s stage file at point
  u unstage file at point
  S stage all changes
  U unstage all changes
  <tab> shows diff of uncommited changes for the file at point
  c opens commit buffer 
    C-c C-c will commit all commited changes
    C-c C-a allows to ammend commit
  C-h b shows relevant bindings

## elpa (Emacs Lisp Packages Archive)
M-x package-list-packages loads the package list available for emacs
  i mark for installation
  x performs installation of marked packages
